#### General Certifications

Besides the regular course work, and reading technical documentation I steer my mind in directions. I love learning new things and free certifications are enticing, not for adding value to my resume but for teaching me something new. I try and complete them in a week, if I am unable to do so they go in to the side projects folder in my laptop.
