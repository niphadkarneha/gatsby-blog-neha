Development

Sublime Text 3 - Sublime Text is my editor of choice. It's fast, has good package support, and it runs everywhere I need it (except ssh).
VSCode - VSCode has become my go-to editor for compiled languages (mostly Python and Rust). It's ecosystem is just as rich as SublimeText. It's not quite as fast, and I'm not totally in-love with its preference for single-workspace layouts, but I'm slowly transitioning to it.
