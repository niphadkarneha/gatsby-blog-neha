# Part 1

## To Err is Human - Alexander Pope

Have you accidentally deleted a file of code? Or Have you accidentally overwritten or replaced a code that was important? If your answer is Yes,
you are not alone my friend :) To safeguard against our own behavior, our fellow human created a system called as, "Version Control" and like the name suggest it
let's you keep a track of all the versions of your code. It will keep a track of all the small and big changes you make to your files.
Let’s dive into it

### Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Version control meaning, every time you make changes to a file you are creating a new version of it. Git lets you keep track of the multiple versions you have created.
You can find the git manual right [here](https://git-scm.com/docs) - Git. Once you’ve read the manual you can take a small quiz that will test you knowledge of Git.

### Git is not GitHub. So What is it, Then?

At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
The link to GitHub guides is [here](https://guides.github.com/). If you don’t want to go through the entire manual, I completely understand.
I can tell you basic commands to get you started but before that let's create your account on GitHub.

In order, to sign up go to [www.github.com](https://github.com/)

GitHub will ask you series of questions, and will ask you to choose a plan. I have chosen the, "Free" plan which gives you access to unlimited public and private
repositories. repositories are folder that will contain your documentation, code, text files, images, etc.

Once, you are done with the set up question, you will be asked to verify your account. Upon, verification you will come to your GitHub page with a message that will
look like this
