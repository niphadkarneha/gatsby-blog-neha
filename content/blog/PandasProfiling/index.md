Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is inarguably the first step on the path of finding patterns and meaning in your data. EDA entails a lot of manual work like data cleaning, transformation, and storing. It might not be fun for some people, you might make an error, and it can be time consuming. There was and still is a way to get the basic statistics fairly quickly and the pandas library provides a function called, ".describe()"</strong>. It is used to view basic statistics of a dataset like count, mean, standard deviation (sd), percentiles, min, and max.

For e.g. we will use a publicly available dataset from the seaborn data pool, for the purpose of this article I am using the diamonds dataset and there are other's available as well, you can check them out [here](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data).

Open a Google Colab and copy paste the code given below

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/diamonds.csv')
df.describe()
```

There is a better module out there that gives us more than the base statistics. Pandas Profiling generates reports from a pandas DataFrame, pandas_profiling extends the DataFrame and provides us quick analysis

Similar to the code above with one additional import we can generate a Descriptive report and save it as a html file to be published.

```python
pip install -U pandas-profiling
```

The type of data generated is mentioned below

1. Essentials: type, unique values, missing values
2. Quantile statistics like minimum value, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, range, interquartile range
3. Descriptive statistics like mean, mode, standard deviation, sum, median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, and skewness.
4. Most frequent values
5. Histogram
6. Correlations highlighting of highly correlated variables, Spearman, Pearson and Kendall matrices
7. Missing values matrix, count, heatmap and dendrogram of missing values
