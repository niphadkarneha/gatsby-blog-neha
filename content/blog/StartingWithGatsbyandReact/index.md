This is my first attempt at building a Gatsby site.

It's a hot summer day in India and I decided to spend some
part of my holiday learning a tool that is unrelated to my research 
or job. I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

I love reading blogs and articles on Medium and that how I stumbled on
[Playing with Gatsby JS](https://medium.com/@martinho_t/playing-with-gatsby-js-68127ed448b1).

>More often than not as a developer you will need to create a static web page. Either creating a portfolio of your projects, a product landing page, etc.

I found these tutorials extremely useful
