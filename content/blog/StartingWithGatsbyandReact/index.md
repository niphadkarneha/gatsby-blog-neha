This is my first attempt at building a React/Gatsby site.

It's a hot summer day in India and I have decided to spend some
part of my holiday learning javascript and react. I love reading blogs and articles, particularly on Medium and that's how I stumbled on [Playing with Gatsby JS](https://medium.com/@martinho_t/playing-with-gatsby-js-68127ed448b1).

>More often than not as a developer you will need to create a static web page. Either creating a portfolio of your projects, a product landing page, etc.

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:42%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/rY93u9tQbybks" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/great-dicaprio-leonardo-rY93u9tQbybks">via GIPHY</a></p>

I found these tutorials extremely useful, GatsbyJS has plenty of boiler-plate code/library that you can start off with and once you get comfortable with the enviroment and architecture, you can make something of your own. I've had fun building this blog site, I hope you enjoy it too.
