#Work-In-Progress

CS50 or Computer Science 50 is a series of introductory course taught at Harvard University. Amongst the lecture series,  
[CS50 2019 - Lecture 6 - Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL308_-Kbt0) taught by Dr. David Malan is one of the best introductory courses out there.
I learned python on my own through scraping the web but CS50 python course is absolute joy to watch. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is trying or
thinking of learning python. Towards the end of Lecture 6, Dr. Malan plays with Facial Recognition and I could not help but think when I started out it was not this easy.

Dr. Malan made use of a library in Python called, [Face Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face_recognition/), which is by far the simplest library out there equipped with a lot
of sample source codes. I tried it for myself but I did not the reader of this article to worry about installing libraries of making sure that they had the right version of Python installed.
So, I decided to run the code on Google Colaboratory, all you need to make sure is that you have a google account to sign in.
