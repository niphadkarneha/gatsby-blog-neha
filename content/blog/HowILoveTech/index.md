<strong>I did not fall into the wrong career path nor was I tired of my previous job.</strong> A Greek philosopher named Heraclitus taught me early on that “Change is the only constant”, I’ve carried that with me ever since. Unless you change, unless you learn, you will never grow. I made my career change into Computer Science in 2016. I have been often asked the question of, "How did I make the change?" Without boring you with too many details, I will focus on the main

## Start - Research 📜

I, started out by searching for all the possible degrees offered in the field of Computer Science. The 3 degree programs that peaked my interest right away were

+ [Master's in Computer Science](https://www.odu.edu/academics/programs/masters/computer-science)
+ [Master's in Computer Information Systems](https://www.odu.edu/business/departments/infotech/academics/graduate/master-of-scienceincomputerscience)
+ [Master's in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security](https://graduate.cs.odu.edu/certificates/cybersecurity/)

I, researched about all the Universities within a 100 mile radius who offered these programs. Funding opportunities, Research opportunities, Diversity ratio, Faculty members and Staff, and On campus and off campus housing were all important factors for me. Yes, my pro's and con's list was as extensive as it can be, based on the list and research I ended up picking <strong>Old Dominion University (ODU)</strong> I made an appointment to meet with The Chair Dr. Ravi Mukkamala and The Graduate Program Director Dr. Michele Weigle for Computer Science and they were extremely kind and supportive, we charted out a plan of how I can finish my prerequisites and apply for the Master's program.

> Meeting with the faculty and staff, helped establish a good rapport. It helped put a face to an application.
>>They heard my story, knew what I wanted to achieve, and realized that I was determined to follow through.

## Middle - Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites, if you come from a different field of study be prepared to do a lot of prerequiste courswork. They are an expensive deal for an international student who is paying Out-of-state tuition 💵, we are talking about paying $300 versus $1000 per credit. Faculty members at ODU and I came to a consensus that I would complete all my prerequiste courses at the local [Tidewater Community College (TCC)](https://www.tcc.edu/) for 2 years and then transfer to ODU. The application process for TCC was fairly straightforward and the staff were some of the most helpful people I met as an international student could ever meet.

While at Tidewater Community College, I took course in Math, Statistics, and Computer Science some of them are mentioned below

+ Precalculus
+ Calculus
+ Differential Equations
+ Introduction to Computing
+ Computer Organization
+ Programming with C++

Once I completed these courses, I started my transfer/application process to ODU. It was honestly nerve-wracking but I did get into the program. 

> I initially applied for a Master's in Computer Information Systems (CIS) but transferred to Master's in Computer Science right after my first semester.

## End - Master's in Computer Science 👩🏽‍🎓

Right into my first semester I realized that I was more passionate about programming and switched my Major from CIS to Computer Science. The process of transitioning into Computer Science has been long, hard, and filled with a lot of ups and downs. I am grateful for this journey but it would not have been possible without mentioning a few things
