A Greek philosopher named Heraclitus taught me early on that "Change is the only constant". I've carried that with me ever since. Unless you change, unless you learn, you will never grow. I made my career change into
all things technology in the year 2016. I did not fall into a wrong career nor was I tired of my previous job. I often get the Why? How? and When? and This is that story

## The Beginning preceedes the Why?
I vaguely remember the first time I heard about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, I was a child back then and did not fully comprehend why the grown ups were so fascinated by them and what they had created for us. I was happy playing Nintendo indoor and cricket outdoors. Yes, I was that tomboy and I did play gully criket. I remember being introduced to MS Office and the internet and opening up my first AOL and Yahoo accounts. My maternal uncle gave me a book that I still have to this date called, "Introduction to C++ by Delores M. Etter". I learned about internal organizations of a computer, data types, flow sequences and how to do basic math. As a child it was all fascinating.

After highschool, I went to one of the best colleges in the cities and it was love at first sight. Not that I am a believer but I knew Sophia's was the place I wanted to go. It was a college in downtown Mumbai. It was there that I was introduced to Psychology and in all of my academic life I had not came across a more complex field of study. I was astonished rather shocked with the number of people who need and seek help in daily life and how there is a shortage of right personnel in the field. Thus began my five year journey into the study of psychology. I specialized in the Applied field of Industrial and Organizational psychology and got my Master's degree. I worked in the Department of Human Resources in 2 different Digital Media agencies while in India.

## The Middle - Why? How? and When?
While working there I was incharge of HRIS, Human Resource Information System. What might have been a rather expensive task for the company and what I found silly was there were 3 different systems in place. We had independent tools for attendance, payroll, and taxes. It took several human hours at the end of every month to get salaries out in time when all of these tools could have been linked for better processing. Saving time, money, and resources. I decided to spend my spare time whatever I had left to learn programming. Pun not intended but the benefits of being into HR, is that you have the access to human resources. I went to Head of Department for IT and asked him the basics. He introduced me to W3Schools.com.

I knew If I did not have a strong understanding of the basic concepts I would not good at anything. I did what any student who did not want huge student debts, I went to a community college and enrolled in Programming with C++(CS210). Tidewater Community College was one of the best decisions I took. Anybody who went to TCC Norfolk/VB will tell you about the amazing professor named, Scott Davis. He is an amazing mentor for someone who wants to learn programming. His classes were 95 percent hands on programming, I ended up writing 5-7 programms in one class. It was all about finding syntax errors, whiteboarding, and a lot of projects.

After getting familiar with the basics I transferred to Old Dominion University which is also based in Norfolk, VA.

## Present

Here's the [tl;dr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) of my story:

- I've always loved the possibilities of how tech can improve our lives.
- I loved studying and practising IOP and I love studying CS.
- The hardest part of all was thinking If I am too late to make the switch.
- I did a three month unpaid internship inorder to get a job on campus that would pay for my tuition.
- The seed of an idea for a career change began in March, 2014.
- I hope to get a job in this new chosen field.

The End Is Only The Beginning.


- Yes, I am a big movie buff.
