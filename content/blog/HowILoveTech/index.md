<strong>I did not fall into the wrong career path nor was I tired of my previous job.</strong> A Greek philosopher named Heraclitus taught me early on that “Change is the only constant”, I’ve carried that with me ever since. Unless you change, unless you learn, you will never grow. I made my career change into Computer Science in the year 2016. I often get the Why? How? and When? and This is that story.

# Start - Research

I started out by searching for all the possible degrees offered in the field of Computer Science. The 3 degree programs that peaked my interest right away were

1. Master's degree in Computer Science
2. Master's degree in Computer Information Systems
3. Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security.

I researched about all the Universities within a 100 mile radius who offered these programs. I found out the funding opportunities, research opportunities, diversity ratio, faculty members, and housing. Yes, my pro's and con's list was as extensive as it can be, based on the list and extensive research I ended up picking <strong>Old Dominion University (ODU)</strong> I made an appointment to meet with The Chair Dr. Ravi Mukkamala and The Graduate Program Director Dr. Michele Weigle for Computer Science and they were extremely kind and supportive, we charted out a plan of how I can finish my prerequisites and apply for the Master's program. 

# Middle - Pre-requisites

Pre-requisites can be an expensive deal for an international student who is paying Out-of-state tuition, thus we came to a consensus that I would complete all my prerequiste courses at the local Tidewater Community College (TCC) for 2 years and then transfer to ODU. The application process for TCC was fairly straightforward and the staff was some of the most helpfull people I as an international student could ever meet.

While at Tidewater Community College, I took course in both Math and Computer Science some of them are mentioned below

1. Precalculus
2. Calculus
3. Differential Equations
4. Introduction to Computing
5. Computer Organization
6. Programming with C++

Once I completed these courses, I started my transfer/application process at ODU. It was honestly nerve-wracking but I did get into the program. I initially applied for a Master's in Computer Information Systems but right into my first semester I realized that I was more suited and passionate for Master's in Computer Science. I made the switch right after my first semester.

# End - Graduate Student

The process of transitioning into Computer Science has been long, hard, and filled with a lot of ups and downs. I am grateful for this journey but it would not have been possible without mentioning these kind people

A non-exhaustive list.

- [Kirk Dewyea: Director of Training and Assessment at ODU](https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/k/kdewyea) - Kirk guided me on how to take my prerequisite courses at TCC. He is a great guide and mentor.
- [Dr. Michele C. Weigle: Graduate Program Director](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/) - Brilliant researcher, kind human being, and to the point in her meetings.
- [Ajay Gupta: Director of Computer Resources](https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/a/ajay) - This man is a legend.
- [Ariel Sturtevant: Graduate Programs](https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/a/astur001) - Guide, A fellow travel buddy, and friend for life.
