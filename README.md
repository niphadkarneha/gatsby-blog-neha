I'm a Data Analytics Manager at Old Dominion University, proudly supporting Digital Transformation and Technology in Norfolk, Virginia. While my day job is all about data strategy and insights, I often find myself happily falling down coding rabbit holes.

I studied Computer Science at Tidewater Community College and Old Dominion University, where my love for data and storytelling took root. Outside of work, I‚Äôm an avid traveler - I love being in nature, bookworm, and unapologetic Bollywood buff.

And if you're here for the fun stuff... meet Leo ‚Äî my 10-pound sidekick and lovable chaos agent who keeps me on my toes. üêæ

Also, I'd like you to meet Leo, little 10 pound monster who keeps me on my toes <img src="./leo.jpg" width="700" height="850">
