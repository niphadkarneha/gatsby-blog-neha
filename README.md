# Hello, World ðŸ˜€

I work for [MAP Communications, Inc](https://www.mapcommunications.com) in Virginia. I stumble into coding ever so often. I studied Computer Science at [Tidewater Community College](https://www.tcc.edu) and [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/compsci).

At MAP my day to day activities involve building interactive dashboards, creating comprehensive reports, and automating processes in order to save valuable human hours.

I love traveling, reading, taking photos, and musicals (Bollywood Buff). I'm learning how to play a guitar ðŸŽ¸ and a keyboard ðŸŽ¹ . My resume is available if you want to be all formal and the usual stuff â¬‡

Also, I'd like you to meet Leo, little 10 pound monster who keeps me on my toes <img src="./leo.jpg" width="700" height="850">


I also volunteer as a Web applications developer and tester for the local 757-Group. 
I am also an incoming faculty member at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu) where I would be teaching Business Intelligence and Data Analytics with R in Spring 2022.
