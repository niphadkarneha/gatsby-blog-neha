        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg">salted duck eggs</a>.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
        eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
        supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
        charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
        wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
        salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
        firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>
