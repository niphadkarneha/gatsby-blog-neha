Before now, I worked at React Training, CodePen, Amazon, L4 Digital, Clarifai, and Venmo, and graduated from Iowa State University. <br />I run <a href='http://cassidoo.co/newsletter'> a weekly newsletter</a> and love teaching and helping people become better coders! In my spare time, I love playing music, building mechanical keyboards and LEGO sets, and hanging out with <a href='https://twitter.com/cwillycs'>my sister Cami</a>. We also like to make cool things with our laser cutter and 3D printer, and have <a href='https://www.etsy.com/shop/LeakyBucketDesign'>a little Etsy shop</a> if you want to check it out! I also have a <a href='https://www.patreon.com/cassidoo'>Patreon</a> if you'd like to chat with me regularly (our Discord group is so active I can hardly keep up, come join in the fun!), get resume reviews, schedule mock interviews with me, or get a few coupons and gifts from me on occasion.

I also made a successfully funded <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cassidoo/go-on-the-go/'>Kickstarter project called Go: On the Go!</a> to get people interested in playing the game go. I've spoken at over a hundred events around the world, and have made online classes on <a href='https://www.udemy.com/user/cassidywilliams/'>Udemy</a>, <a href='https://www.skillshare.com/r/profile/Cassidy-Williams/3062729'>Skillshare</a>, and moooore.

      //   <blockquote>
      //   <p>A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
      //   eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
      //   supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
      //   charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
      //   wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
      //   salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
      //   firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>
